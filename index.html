				<h1 id="sex">About Us</h1>
					<p>Welcome to the website of TASIS The American School in Switzerland. This site helps to tell the story of what makes this a special school, unrivaled in location, mission, and programs.<br><br>

The story began in 1956 when M. Crist Fleming fulfilled her dream of establishing an American boarding school in the heart of Europe, designed to prepare students for American colleges and universities and to introduce them to European culture and languages.<br> <br>

Today we welcome more than 700 day and boarding students from Pre-Kindergarten to Postgraduate, with 250 students between ages 12-19 residing on campus. With a student body that represents approximately 60 nationalities each year and speaks more than 35 languages as a mother tongue, cultural differences are celebrated as students challenge and inspire one another to become global citizens.<br><br>

Our academic programs provide a rich and varied curriculum that encourages students to find their own voice no matter what the discipline. High School students can choose from a selection of Advanced Placement courses or pursue the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, providing access to colleges and universities around the world. Accredited by the European Council of International Schools (ECIS) and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), we are proud to employ gifted, passionate educators who encourage intellectual curiosity.<br><br>

Our campus includes 25 buildings dating from the 17th century Villa De Nobili to the state-of-the-art Campo Science Center, which opened in 2014. Our enviable location—perched on a hillside in sunny southern Switzerland that commands views of snow-capped mountains to the north, and palm trees, lakes, and the Italian border to the south—makes possible an impressive travel program.<br><br>

Academic travel experiences throughout the year bring students face-to-face with the rich cultural heritage of Europe and the spectacular natural beauty of the Alps and beyond. Our pioneering Global Service Program awakens students to humanitarian needs, inspires them to build enduring relationships, and leads them toward a life of active citizenship and committed service.<br><br>
We encourage physical fitness and healthy lifestyles. Sports teams compete throughout Switzerland and Europe, and a wide variety of other recreational sports and adventure trips are offered to cater to all interests.</p>	
				<h3>MISSION STATEMENT</h3>
				<P>The American School in Switzerland (TASIS) is a family of international schools that welcomes young people from all nationalities to an educational community that fosters a passion for excellence along with mutual respect and understanding. Consistent with the vision of its founder, M. Crist Fleming, TASIS is committed to transmitting the heritage of Western civilization and world cultures: the creations, achievements, traditions, and ideals from the past that offer purpose in the present and hope for the future. Seeking to balance the pursuit of knowledge with the love of wisdom, and promoting the skills of lifelong learning, an appreciation for beauty, and the development of character, each school combines a challenging academic program with opportunities for artistic endeavor, physical activity, and service to others. Believing in the worth of each individual and the importance of enduring relationships, TASIS seeks to embody and instill the values of personal responsibility, civility, compassion, justice, and truth.
